# Splunk-Lab
In this lab I gained hands-on experience with Splunk, a powerful data analytics platform. 
I focused on the core functions of Splunk to search, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data.

Setup: Configured a Splunk instance, created an admin role, and set up multiple users with specific roles.
Data Management: Practiced indexing data to enable its use in searches and reports.
Search & Reporting: Developed basic to advanced search skills, starting with simple keyword searches and progressing to more complex queries using wildcards and Boolean expressions to refine results.
Insight Generation: Utilized Splunk's features to create statistical tables, reports, and visualizations from large datasets.
